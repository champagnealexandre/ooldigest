    "abstract": "<strong>Score:</strong> 81/100 | <strong>Category:</strong> Unclassified<br /> \n        <strong>AI Summary:</strong> The paper presents a novel computational tool for RNA structural analysis, which is relevant to understanding the molecular mechanisms that could inform abiogenesis pathways in astrobiology.<br /> \n        <hr /> \n        <strong>Abstract:</strong><br /> \n        Motivation: RNA molecules adopt dynamic ensembles of secondary structures, where the local structural context of each nucleotide--such as whether it resides in a stem or a specific type of loop--strongly shapes molecular interactions and regulatory function. Structural-context probabilities therefore provide a more functionally informative view of RNA folding than the minimum free energy structures or base-pairing probabilities. However, existing tools either require O(N3) time or employ span-restricted approximations that omit long-range base-pairs, limiting their applicability to large and biologically important RNAs. Results: We introduce LinearCapR, enabling linear-time, span-unrestricted computation of structural-context marginalized probabilities, using beam-pruned Stochastic Context Free Grammar-based computation. LinearCapR retains global ensemble features lost by span-limited methods and yields superior predictive power on bpRNA-1m(90) dataset, especially for multiloops and exterior regions, as well as long-distance stems. LinearCapR supports analysis of long RNAs, demonstrated on the full genome of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: LinearCapR provides the first base-pair-span-unrestricted, linear-time framework for RNA structural context analysis, retaining key thermodynamic ensemble features essential for functional interpretation. It enables large-scale studies of viral genomes, long non-coding RNAs, and downstream analyses such as RNA-binding protein site prediction.

    "abstract": "arXiv:2512.10060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  \nAbstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant shift in astrochemistry with a renewed focus on the role of non-thermal processes on the molecular interstellar medium, in particular energetic particles (such as cosmic ray particles and fast electrons) and X-ray radiation. This has been brought about in large part due to new observations of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in environments that would inhibit their formation, such as cold, dense gas in prestellar cores or in the highly energetic environments in galactic centers. In parallel, there has been a plethora of new laboratory investigations on the role of high-energy radiation and electrons on the chemistry of astrophysical ices, demonstrating the ability of this radiation to induce complex chemistry. In recent years, theoretical models have also begun to include newer cosmic-ray-driven processes in both the gas and ice phases. In this review, we unify aspects of the chemistry driven by X-ray radiation and energetic particles into a ``high-energy astrochemistry'', defining this term and reviewing the underlying chemical processes. We conclude by examining various laboratories where high-energy astrochemistry is at play and identify future issues to be tackled.",
