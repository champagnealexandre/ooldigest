    "abstract": "arXiv:2512.21470v1 Announce Type: new  \nAbstract: Ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy has identified various chemical species in the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters, including neutral and ionized metals, providing key insights into planet formation through refractory element abundances. We observed the dayside thermal emission spectrum of the UHJ HAT-P-70b using the high-resolution spectrographs CARMENES and PEPSI. Through cross-correlation analysis, we detect emission signals of Al i, AlH, Ca ii, Cr i, Fe i, Fe ii, Mg i, Mn i, and Ti i, marking the first detection of Al i and AlH in an exoplanetary atmosphere. Tentative signals of C i, Ca i, Na i, NaH, and Ni i are also identified. These detections enable atmospheric retrievals to constrain the thermal profile and elemental abundances of the planet's dayside hemisphere. The retrieved temperature-pressure profile reveals a strong thermal inversion. The chemical free retrieval yields a metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.38(+0.74/-1.11), while the chemical equilibrium retrieval gives [Fe/H] = 0.23(+1.08/-0.98), both consistent with solar metallicity. We also tentatively find an enhanced abundance of Ni, possibly due to the accretion of Ni-rich planetesimals during formation. On the other hand, elements with condensation temperatures above 1400 K (e.g., Ca, Ti, and V) appear slightly depleted, which may be caused by nightside cold trapping. However, Al, with the highest condensation temperature at 1653K, displays a solar like abundance, which might reflect the formation-related enrichment of Al. Our retrieval indicates extremely high volume mixing ratios of metal ions (Fe ii and Ca ii), which are significantly inconsistent with predictions from chemical equilibrium models. This disequilibrium suggests that the atmosphere is likely undergoing significant hydrodynamic escaping, which enhances the atmospheric density at high altitudes where the ionic lines are formed.",

Radioisotope dating of planetesimal disruption events recorded in meteorites confirms frequent catastrophic collisions in the first $\\sim$10 Myr of the Solar System, reflecting a violent environment of the time. However, the nebula gas can damp the eccentricity of planetesimals and suppress the frequency of planetesimal collisions. Strong dynamical mechanisms that excited the protoplanetary disk are required. Here we show that the sweeping secular resonances of Jupiter and Saturn induced by the nebular gas dissipation, together with the mean motion resonances of Jupiter, can trigger a large number of catastrophic collisions, which occur episodically when the secular resonances are at $\\sim$2-3 au and continue thereafter. After the gas dissipation completes, catastrophic collisions decrease in frequency, with scattering by planetary embryos becoming the major driving force of the collisions. Our results suggest that the violent environment excited by secular and mean motion resonances can be ubiquitous in protoplanetary disks during nebula dissipation.",

    "abstract": "arXiv:2509.08994v2 Announce Type: replace  \nAbstract: Snowball episodes are associated with increases in atmospheric oxygen and the complexity of life on Earth, and they may be essential for the development of complex life on exoplanets. Sustained, stable Snowball episodes require a Snowball bifurcation and climate bistability between the globally ice-covered Snowball state and a state with at least some open ocean. We find that climate bistability disappears for an aquaplanet with a slab ocean in the global climate model ExoCAM when the orbital eccentricity is increased to 0.2-0.3. This happens because the Snowball state ceases to exist as seasonal insolation variations intensify, while the warm state remains stable due to the ocean's large heat capacity. We use a low-order ice-thermodynamic model to show that the Snowball state ceases to exist as seasonality increases because winter freezing at the ice bottom is reduced relative to summer melting at the ice top due to ice self-insulation. Combined with previous research showing that Snowball climate bistability diminishes for planets orbiting low-mass stars and ones with longer rotation periods, and that it disappears entirely for tidally locked planets, our work suggests that the Snowball climate bistability may not be as robust to planetary parameters as previously thought, representing one aspect of habitability more consistent with the rare Earth hypothesis than the Copernican principle.",

Most of these stars are close to the Sun and the planet-to-star mass and luminosity ratios are advantageous, allowing for a more detailed follow-up than of planets orbiting hotter and more massive stars. Many more planets orbiting late-type stars are expected to be discovered by Gaia and PLATO in the following years. However, the lingering question remains whether the UV and X-ray emission, associated with the stellar activity, allows for complex life. A comprehensive study focused on properties of flaring exoplanet hosts and their activity, on a much larger scale than these few tens (soon to become hundreds) of stars with habitable planets is called for, to answer the question if such stars can harbor habitable planets. The proposed Wide Field Survey telescope is well suited for this study.",

This has been brought about in large part due to new observations of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in environments that would inhibit their formation, such as cold, dense gas in prestellar cores or in the highly energetic environments in galactic centers. In parallel, there has been a plethora of new laboratory investigations on the role of high-energy radiation and electrons on the chemistry of astrophysical ices, demonstrating the ability of this radiation to induce complex chemistry. In recent years, theoretical models have also begun to include newer cosmic-ray-driven processes in both the gas and ice phases. In this review, we unify aspects of the chemistry driven by X-ray radiation and energetic particles into a ``high-energy astrochemistry'', defining this term and reviewing the underlying chemical processes. We conclude by examining various laboratories where high-energy astrochemistry is at play and identify future issues to be tackled.",
