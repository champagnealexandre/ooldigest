    "summary": "Unraveling the kinetics of transcriptional regulation is a central challenge in molecular biology. Traditional inference methods based on cell-to-cell mRNA variability are limited because mRNA levels reflect not only transcriptional activity but also post-transcriptional processes. Recent advances in quantifying nascent RNAs across isogenic cells provide a more direct readout of transcriptional dynamics. Here, we present a moments-based theoretical framework that leverages nascent RNA data to infer transcriptional kinetics. We derive closed-form expressions for the first two time-dependent moments of nascent RNA across three canonical transcription models and demonstrate that nascent RNA exhibits distinct transient overshoots and higher Fano factors compared to mature mRNA. Through analysis of synthetic datasets, we show that these features enable more accurate estimation of transcriptional kinetics and allow reliable model selection, distinguishing single from multi-pathway promoter activation with over 75% accuracy even from small sample sizes. We further validated our model selection method using real experimental transcription datasets in yeast and E. coli cells, with nascent RNA demonstrating superior performance in identifying cross-talk pathway regulation. Our framework thus offers a computationally efficient and mechanistically informative approach for decoding transcriptional dynamics, emphasizing the advantages of time-dependent nascent RNA measurements over mature mRNA in capturing the true kinetics of transcriptional regulation.",

The spatio-functional relationship between transcription of rRNA and nucleolar substructures and how this adapts to cellular stress remain incompletely understood. In this study, we resolve the sub nucleolar structures using expansion microscopy to reveal ordered structures of fibrillar center (FC) and dense fibrillar component (DFC) domains as nested shells, which is reorganized upon cellular stress like DNA damage or RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) inhibition. Direct visualization of nascent (5' ETS) and mature (28S) rRNA suggested that rRNA synthesis is the critical regulator of nucleolar size, and organization. Nucleolar reorganization upon stress emerges to be a direct function of nascent rRNA levels. Stress-induced transcription inhibition remodels the sub-nucleolar compartments from a viscoelastic state into solid-like condensates thereby perturbing the nucleolar pH gradient due to the missing rRNA scaffold. We show, that rather than signalling to mediate rDNA repair, nucleolar reorganization naturally arises primarily from reduced rRNA levels and the resultant biophysical restructuring of the nucleolus under cellular stress.",
